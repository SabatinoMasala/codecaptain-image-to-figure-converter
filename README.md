# CodeCaptain image to figure converter Wordpress Plugin

## Installation
Put these files inside a folder in `wp-content/plugins` and activate the plugin in your Wordpress dashboard.

## What does it do?

This plugin will loop over all images in your post and wrap them in a new structure. It will also make the responsive images reserve space in the page, preventing a reflow when the images load on a slow connection.
